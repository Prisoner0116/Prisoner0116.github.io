### 学习是很困难，但请不要放弃

作为一个软件开发人员，我们经常不得不学习一些新事物，新技术，新的工具，新的框架，流程，原则，有时候还需要学习新的不同业务领域的业务知识。软件开发行业时刻在发生着变化。

学习驱使我们前进，因为学习使我们能够快速解决新的问题，或者更好的解决老问题。

但是学习有时候也会让我们很受挫折。新事物的文档（工具，技术等等）通常都不是很好，所以学习新事物通常都会很困难，直到关于这种新事物的书籍出版之后，这种情况就会缓解许多。有时候技术类的书籍也不是很好。至少有一半的技术类书籍（或者商业书籍）是非常混乱的，并不能清晰的、结构化的向读者传达核心思想。

这种挫败感在我们大多数人中时常发生。我常常碰到这种问题。所以，如果你也有这种挫败感，记住，大千世界，你并不是唯一一个。话不多说，在接下来的文章中，我将会告诉你我用什么方法来克服这种挫败感，并且克服不好的文档带来的障碍。

#### 你并不蠢（You Are Not Stupid）

第一件你需要知道的事就是你并不蠢。很多人在学习新事物的时候会感到很困难。即使你的朋友/同事比你学得快，这并不一定是因为他们比你聪明。还有其他一些原因。后续我会解释其中的一些原因。

千万千万不要告诉自己你是愚蠢的。如果你非要告诉自己什么，那就告诉你自己：`闻道有先后，术业有专攻`，你只是没有学习过这个领域的知识。

#### 知识储备（Prior Knowledge）

你的朋友和同事之所以学习某些领域东西比你快，也许是因为他们有了一些关于这些领域的知识储备。他们也许以前就学习过这些。也许他们在学校的时候就学习过该领域的一些课程、阅读过关于这方面的书籍和一些文章，也许早就玩过这种技术。甚至在其他的公司使用过相似的技术，并且有同事告诉他们这些技术是如何工作的。

有了一定的知识储备使得学习更加容易，学习自己已经有所了解并且有了一定基础知识的技术和学习自己完全没有听过的技术，还是有明显区别的。

#### 兴趣和动力（Interest and Motivation）

你的朋友和同事学的比你快的另一个原因，也许是因为他们对给定的领域有强烈的兴趣。强烈的兴趣通常会强烈的驱使一个人去学习。这种动力通常驱使人们不断的学习这个领域的知识，并不是因为他们不得不去学习，而是因为他们想去学。

如果你正在学习某一个领域是因为你工作中或者学校里不得不去学习，你并没有很强烈的个人兴趣去学习，和这些有着强烈兴趣的人相比，这将会使你处在一个不利的位置。即使如此，你还是可以学习相关的知识。

#### 不轻言放弃（Don't Give Up）

当你意识到你并不笨的时候，你也会意识到，如果你真的要去学习它，只不过是你投入精力多少的问题。所以，不要轻言放弃。继续努力，迟早你会了解它。但是一定要有心里准备，你可能要比其他人付出更多的努力。

在下面的章节中我将会阐述当我再学习中遇到挫折的时候我是怎么做的

#### Reread the Book

There is nothing more frustrating than a book that is hard to understand. It makes you feel stupid. However, as you gain more and more experience, you get better at distinguishing between your own incompetence and a book that just doesn't explain a topic very well. Lots of books are just not very good.

If you don't understand a book the first time you read it, you might benefit from rereading the book. The second time you read the book your brain doesn't have to work as hard to understand the parts you already understood the first time you read the book. That leaves more brain capacity for the parts you did not understand during first read.

I have had books I needed to read up to 5 times before I finally understood everything in them. First time I might have understood something like 20-50% of the book. Each reread then added another 10% or so, and finally I understood it all. 

#### Read More Books

Another technique I often use is to read more than one book about a given topic. The different books are not always weak in the same areas. Thus, if I understand 40% of the topic from the first book, I might add another 20% to that from reading the second book.

Combine reading multiple books with rereading the books. If you understand 20% from the first book, then and additional 30% from the second book, you now know 50%. With that knowledge, go back and reread the first book. Most likely you will be able to get another 5-10-20% out of it now. And then you can return to the second book etc.

It is not uncommon for me to use 2-3 books on a given topic to cover all the necessary ground. Also, I keep switching between them until I have understood everything I can from them. 

#### Use More Sources

When I cannot get books about a certain topic, or if the books are weak in certain areas, I often supplement with online resources. Tutorials in article and video form are often very useful supplements. Articles often dive deeper into narrow topics, or give a more brief overview than a book can. The same with videos.

Again, I often read several different articles and watch several different videos about the same topic, until I finally feel I understand it. 

#### Make Examples

When what I have to learn is programming related I often find it beneficial to make code examples myself. I open an IDE / editor, type in the examples in the book (or make up my own examples) and check that I get the expected result. I guess you could even setup unit tests for that, but I often just use a main() method to run my examples. 

#### Ask People

If you really cannot understand a certain topic, or a small part of it, ask people. If you have friends or colleagues that understand the topic ask them to explain it to you. You will be surprised about how often they are willing to do so. You might think they will think you are stupid - and maybe they will. But once you can demonstrate that understand the topic - after their explanation, they will usually not think you are so stupid anymore. Now you understand, right? 

#### Few Will Remember How Long it Took For You To Learn a Topic

Don't be afraid that your employer, friends or colleagues will think you are stupid, or a slow learner. They will usually forget once they realize you have learned the topic. Some years later, nobody remembers how long time you took to learn a given topic.

Even if they did remember, their current experience is that you do understand the topic, so it doesn't really carry so much weight. Chances are, they have topics themselves where they too had to spend a long time to learn them. Most experienced developers will understand that, and not hold that against you.

In the end, all that matters is that you learned. Not how long time it took to learn it. 

#### Summary

So, you should definitely not give up. You might need longer time than others to learn a certain topic, but that doesn't mean you cannot learn it. It just means you have to spend more time learning it. And - you can compensate for that exactly by spending more time on it.

Reread the books, read multiple books, use multiple sources, make examples and ask people.

With each iteration your understanding grows. In the end you will understand the topic, and when you do - nobody will remember how long time it took you to learn it.
